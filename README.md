### Hello, stalker 👀

I'm Lucas Seiki Oshiro, but you can call me whatever you want.

This profile may be a little bit messy... Some of the repos here are cool side projects, some are related to my university, and some are forks. So, if you are interested about what I've done, I really suggest you to check out my personal page:

- 🇬🇧 https://lucasoshiro.github.io/en/
- 🇧🇷 https://lucasoshiro.github.io

I try to keep that page regularly updated with interesting things that I'm doing and learning.

If you are interesting in my experience and skills, you can check [my detailed resume](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/cv-en/).
